# Web Chess Board
In a desire to keep programming while looking for a job, but also to learn a little more about JavaScript, I am creating a webpage to facilitate a Chess game.

## Objectives
- Become more familiar with JavaScript.
- Gain a better understanding of what React is doing behind the scenes.
- Learn more about my personal development process, and possibly pick up more tools to help with a better workflow.

## What am I doing
Board has been created, but not exactly the way that I wanted to. However, it is in enough of a workable state that I am able to start creating Game rules.

In terms of creating those Game Rules, I am working on figuring out how I will be determining the win condition, and how I will be checking for the win condition. This will probably involve adding a `checkGame()` function at the end of the `clickTile()` function.
