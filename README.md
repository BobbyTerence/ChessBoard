# Web Chess Board
In a desire to keep programming while looking for a job, but also to learn a little more about JavaScript, I am creating a webpage to facilitate a Chess game.

### Table of Contents

- [Learning and Resources](https://github.com/BobbyTerence/ChessBoard/blob/main/lessons-learned.md)

## Objectives
- Become more familiar with JavaScript.
- Gain a better understanding of what React is doing behind the scenes.
- Learn more about my personal development process, and possibly pick up more tools to help with a better workflow.

## What am I doing
I am going to create a `square` class and use `.scss` to make a square to represent the board pieces

In order to keep border width consistent, I might have to resort to defining styling rules as I create the tile instead of keeping static style rules for it.
